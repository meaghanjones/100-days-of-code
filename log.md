[You can also follow my progress on twitter! @meaghanwonder](https://twitter.com/meaghanwonder)

### Day 1: January 22nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I am working on JS tutorials for free code camp so I can do well on my upcoming technical interview.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.


### Day 2: January 23rd, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** This is a review for me and it's great that it's so much easier reviewing JS that it was learning it the first time.


### Day 3: January 24th, Tuesday 

**Today's Progress**: I am still working on the JS section of the Free Code Camp exercises. 

**Thoughts**: I am looking forward to finishing these exercises so I can get started on the projects. I also decided to do more than an hour and try to brush up on learning Angular2. I am following a really great tutorial that is walking me through the process of building a fully functional CRUD todo app. So far it has been really helpful and I will continue working on understanding everything that is going on.
